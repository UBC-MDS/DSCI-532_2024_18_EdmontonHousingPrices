    "\n",
    "Explaining complex data science concepts to non-technical audience is a valuable skills set for any data scientists. By doing so, you can clearly communicate the results of their analysis and the insights they have gained, helping non-technical audiences to **understand the significance and implications of their work**. By writing clearly and concisely, data scientists can ensure that their ideas and insights are understood by their colleagues and that they can **work together effectively**. Finally, it can help you **build credibility and trust with your colleagues**, and demonstrate the value and relevance of your work."

    "- **Use examples**: Illustrate your points with examples or case studies to help make the material more relatable and easier to understand.\n",
    "- **Break down complex concepts** If you are explaining a complex concept, break it down into smaller, more manageable pieces and explain each piece separately.\n",

    "In deep learning, a convolutional neural network (CNN, or ConvNet) is a class of artificial neural network (ANN), most commonly applied to analyze visual imagery.[1] CNNs are also known as Shift Invariant or Space Invariant Artificial Neural Networks (SIANN), based on the shared-weight architecture of the convolution kernels or filters that slide along input features and provide translation-equivariant responses known as feature maps.[2][3] Counter-intuitively, most convolutional neural networks are not invariant to translation, due to the downsampling operation they apply to the input.[4] They have applications in image and video recognition, recommender systems,[5] image classification, image segmentation, medical image analysis, natural language processing,[6] brain–computer interfaces,[7] and financial time series.[8]\n",
    ">>\n",
    "CNNs are regularized versions of multilayer perceptrons. Multilayer perceptrons usually mean fully connected networks, that is, each neuron in one layer is connected to all neurons in the next layer. The \"full connectivity\" of these networks make them prone to overfitting data. Typical ways of regularization, or preventing overfitting, include: penalizing parameters during training (such as weight decay) or trimming connectivity (skipped connections, dropout, etc.) CNNs take a different approach towards regularization: they take advantage of the hierarchical pattern in data and assemble patterns of increasing complexity using smaller and simpler patterns embossed in their filters. Therefore, on a scale of connectivity and complexity, CNNs are on the lower extreme.\n",

    "Varada is a data scientist who is working on natural language processing (NLP), in particular, using word embeddings (word2vec) to classify restaurant reviews as positive or negative. Varada is going to meet with a group of restaurant owners to present her findings. \n",
    "\n",
    "Varada quickly googled an explanation of word2vec, and here's the first result from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word2vec)\n",
    "\n",
    ">>\n",
    "Word2vec is a group of related models that are used to produce word embeddings. These models are shallow, two-layer neural networks that are trained to reconstruct linguistic contexts of words. Word2vec takes as its input a large corpus of text and produces a vector space, typically of several hundred dimensions, with each unique word in the corpus being assigned a corresponding vector in the space.\n",
    ">>\n",
    "Word2vec can utilize either of two model architectures to produce these distributed representations of words: continuous bag-of-words (CBOW) or continuous skip-gram. In both architectures, word2vec considers both individual words and a sliding window of context words surrounding individual words as it iterates over the entire corpus. In the continuous bag-of-words architecture, the model predicts the current word from the window of surrounding context words. The order of context words does not influence prediction (bag-of-words assumption). In the continuous skip-gram architecture, the model uses the current word to predict the surrounding window of context words.[1][2] The skip-gram architecture weighs nearby context words more heavily than more distant context words. According to the authors' note,[3] CBOW is faster while skip-gram does a better job for infrequent words.\n",
    ">>\n",
    "After the model has trained, the learned word embeddings are positioned in the vector space such that words that share common contexts in the corpus — that is, words that are semantically and syntactically similar — are located close to one another in the space.[1] More dissimilar words are located farther from one another in the space.[1]\n",
    ">>\n",
    "This occurs because words which influence relative word probabilities in similar ways will have learned similar embeddings once the model has finished. For example, consider the CBOW framework, which can be thought of as a ‘fill in the blank’ task. The learned embedding for a word will represent the way in which, when that word appears in a context window, it influences the relative probabilities of other words appearing in the ‘blank,’ or the position at the center of the context window. Therefore, words which are semantically similar should influence these probabilities in similar ways, because semantically similar words should be used in similar contexts.\n",

    "Holding a Ph.D in NLP, Varada finds all of this 'easy to understand'... However, she is well aware that the group of restaurant owners might find it confusing. Varada turned to you, her trusted friend, to help her simplify the explanation of word2vec for the restaurant owners"
